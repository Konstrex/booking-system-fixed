## üöÄ Deployment

### Prerequisites

- Cloudflare Workers account
- Google Cloud project with Calendar API enabled
- Google service account with access to the Calendar
- MCP Server for backend processing

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Konstrex/booking-system-fixed.git
cd booking-system-fixed
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Configure environment variables**

The following environment variables need to be set either in the wrangler.toml file or using Cloudflare's secrets:

- **Google Calendar Integration**
  - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL` - Already configured to "andrianadelcheva@totemic-point-453101-s4.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
  - `GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY` - Your service account private key 
  - `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID` - The ID of the calendar to use

- **Email Configuration**
  - `EMAIL_FROM` - Email address to send confirmations from
  - `BUSINESS_NAME` - Name of the business (already set to "Andriana Delcheva")
  - `BUSINESS_EMAIL` - Business email for reply-to

- **MCP Server Integration**
  - `MCP_ENABLED` - Set to "true" to enable MCP integration
  - `MCP_SERVER_URL` - URL of the MCP server
  - `MCP_API_KEY` - API key for authenticating with the MCP server

4. **Set secrets using Wrangler**

For sensitive information, use Wrangler's secret management:

```bash
wrangler secret put GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY
wrangler secret put GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID
wrangler secret put MCP_SERVER_URL
wrangler secret put MCP_API_KEY
```

5. **Deploy to Cloudflare Workers**

```bash
npm run deploy:prod
```

## üìù Google Calendar Setup

To ensure the Google Calendar integration works properly:

1. Ensure the service account has appropriate permissions by adding it to your Google Calendar:
   - Open Google Calendar
   - Go to Calendar Settings
   - Under "Share with specific people," add the service account email:
     `andrianadelcheva@totemic-point-453101-s4.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
   - Set permissions to "Make changes and manage sharing"

2. The JWT authentication is configured to use the correct token_uri:
   `https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token`

## üìß Email Configuration

The system uses MCP Servers for handling email notifications. After a successful booking, an email is sent containing:
- Subject: "Booking Confirmation"
- Appointment details (date, time, service)
- Google Calendar link
- Booking reference number

## ü§ñ MCP Server Integration

MCP Servers are used for enhanced functionality:

1. **Event Notifications** - MCP is notified about key events:
   - Availability checks
   - Booking creations
   - Email confirmations
   - Calendar event creations

2. **Error Handling** - MCP receives detailed error information for monitoring and debugging.

3. **Booking Processing** - The system can offload the entire booking process to MCP if configured.

## üß™ Testing

To test the system locally:

```bash
npm run dev:local
```

For end-to-end testing:

1. Select a date and service
2. Check available time slots
3. Enter customer details
4. Complete the booking
5. Verify the appointment appears in Google Calendar
6. Confirm the confirmation email is received
